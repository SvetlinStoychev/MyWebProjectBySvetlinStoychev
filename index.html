				<h1>SOME OF MY HOBBY PROJECTS</h1>
				<p>Ð¢his is project of "remote control car toy". I made this project when i have 
					to graduate from "Technical University of Varna" actually this was part of my thesis. 
				</p>

				<p>
					 There are two electric power motors, 
					one motor spinning the left wheels of the chassi and the other one spins the right wheels.
				</p>
				<img src="images/myCar2.jpg" alt="arduino car2">
				<p>
					I used one old broken toy car for the chassi.
				</p>
				<img src="images/myCar3.jpg" alt="arduino car3">
				<p>
					Power motors transmits motion to the road wheels through gear reducers.
				</p>
				<img src="images/myCar4.jpg" alt="arduino car4">
				<p>
					The power supply of the car is from six batteries of type "AA". Batteries 
					are connected in series to generate 9 volts.
				</p>
				<img src="images/myCar5.jpg" alt="arduino car5">
				<p>
					Microcontroller "Arduino Mega" was used to control the car. The L293D - 16-pin Motor 
					Driver IC was used to control a set of two DC motors simultaneously in any direction. 
					The L293D is designed to provide bidirectional drive currents of up to 600 mA
					 (per channel) at voltages from 4.5 V to 36 V.
				</p>
				<img src="images/myCar6.jpg" alt="arduino car6">
				<p>
					NRF24L01 wireless transceiver module was used for wireless connection between the 
					car and the remote control. NRF24L01 operates in the 2.4GHz ISM frequency band. 
					It is used to communicate data wirelessly which is specially designed for ultra-low 
					power applications. All the electronics parts i put into an old diskette box type 
					FDD 1.44MB. The wiring harnes are not very nice and tidy, but unfortunately there was 
					no enough time to do everything nice and tidy.
				</p>
				<img src="images/myCar7.jpg" alt="arduino car7">
				<p>
					I put an LCD 16x2 (Liquid Crystal Display ) screen on front of the car to print 
					some info about operation status of the car and never the less to looks more 
					funny and strange.
				</p>
				<img src="images/myCar8.jpg" alt="arduino car8">
				<p>
					For the remote control was used microcontroller "Arduino Nano" and of course 
					NRF24L01 wireless transceiver module. For power supply of the remote control 
					was used one 9 volt battery.

				<h4>About me</h4>
				<p>hi my name is Svetlin Stoychev. This web site is one of my hobby projects, 
					nothing impressive just something about me. I have master degree of 
					"Electronics" from technical university town of Varna. Before university i was 
					studing at special school for "internal combustion engines", 
					i like to repear cars as well. When i was 24 year old, become fireman and for the 
					nex 10 years this was my job. And my dream like kid become tru, i was fireman. 
					After this i went to United Kingdom there i worked in a garage like car electrician 
					and mechanik. In Uk i worked like lorry driver on big truck as well. 
					In all the time when i have free time and energy i try to spend time on my other 
					hobby computers and more specificly lerning programing lenguages and try to do some 
					own projekts.
